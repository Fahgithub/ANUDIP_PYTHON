# ANUDIP_PYTHON
Welcome to the Anudip Python repository! This is a dedicated space for all my Python programs, showcasing my journey through coding and problem-solving.

### Datatypes.py 
This Python script explores various data types, including integers, floats, strings, lists, booleans, and complex numbers, while calculating and displaying their memory sizes using the `sys` library. It demonstrates Python's dynamic typing by checking and printing the type of each variable, providing a foundational understanding of memory usage and data handling in Python.

### Lab_C8255_ConditionalStatement.py
This Python program includes several functionalities:

- It checks if a given number is even or odd.
- It determines a person's eligibility to vote based on age.
- It checks if a specified year is a leap year.
- It evaluates whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero.
- It identifies the largest of three user-provided numbers.

Each segment prompts the user for input, processes the data with conditional statements, and displays the results.

### List.py
This Python script demonstrates the use of lists by defining and manipulating a collection of student marks. It showcases various list operations, including updating values, accessing elements, slicing, and applying list methods such as appending, inserting, removing, and sorting. Additionally, it illustrates iterating over the list and demonstrates how to handle different data types within lists, providing a comprehensive overview of list functionalities in Python.

### Python Lab_C8255_Basic_Handson.py
This Python script demonstrates the usage of various data types, including integers, floats, strings, complex numbers, sets, lists, booleans, tuples, and dictionaries. It begins by printing "Hello World" and then defines several variables of different types. The script uses the `sys` library to print the type and memory size (in bytes) of each variable, providing insight into Python's dynamic typing and memory management. It also includes examples of boolean values and operations with complex numbers, showcasing how to access their real and imaginary parts. This code serves as a comprehensive introduction to basic data types and their properties in Python.

### Python_syntax_operators.py
This Python script demonstrates various operators and variable handling. It covers arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus), naming conventions for variables, and the importance of avoiding keywords as variable names. The script also explores comparison operators, logical operators, assignment operators, identity operators, and membership operators. Overall, it serves as a concise guide to understanding Python's fundamental operations and variable rules.

### Variables_Operators_.py
This Python script illustrates various types of operators and naming conventions for variables. It begins by demonstrating arithmetic operators for performing mathematical calculations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The script also highlights proper naming conventions, including `snake_case` and `CamelCase`, and shows examples of valid variable names.

Further, it covers comparison operators to evaluate relationships between variables, logical operators for combining boolean expressions, and assignment operators for modifying variable values. Additionally, the script introduces identity operators to check object identity and membership operators to determine the presence of elements within a list. Overall, this code serves as a comprehensive overview of fundamental Python operations and best practices for variable naming.

### conditional statement.py
This Python script features a user authentication system, number comparison, and even/odd identification. It begins by prompting the user for a username and password, granting access with a welcome message if the credentials match ("Fahh" and "12345"). If not, it indicates an invalid login. The user is then asked to input a number, which is compared to 10, printing whether it is "greater" or "smaller." In a guessing game, feedback is provided based on whether the number is zero, greater than, smaller than, or equal to 10. The script checks if a given number is even or odd and also includes a `for` loop that iterates through numbers from 1 to 99, identifying and printing each as even or odd. Overall, it illustrates basic programming concepts such as conditionals, user input, and loops in Python.

### input statement.py
This Python script illustrates user input and formatted output. It prompts users to enter their name, course name, student ID, contact number, and height, converting the contact number to an integer and height to a float. After gathering the information, it prints a personalized message with the user's details. The script also demonstrates variable assignment by setting the value of `a` to 11 and printing it. Additionally, it greets the user with their name and provides a personalized message related to their course. Overall, the script showcases basic programming concepts like data types, input handling, and string formatting in Python.

### input.py
This Python snippet prompts the user to enter their name and course. It then uses formatted string output to display a personalized welcome message, encouraging the user to stay on track with their studies. The code effectively demonstrates basic input handling and string formatting in Python.

### loops_while_for.py
This Python code demonstrates various concepts related to loops and string manipulation. It begins with a `while` loop that prints a welcome message twenty times. The code then introduces string handling by showcasing type checking, string methods, and indexing. A sample paragraph is transformed to lowercase and uppercase, and specific characters are accessed through indexing and slicing. The code includes concatenation and repetition of strings, along with membership checks using `in` and `not in`. Lexicographical comparison is illustrated with string variables, followed by printing ASCII characters using the `string` module. The code reverses a string through a loop, replaces substrings, and trims whitespace with methods like `strip()`, `lstrip()`, and `rstrip()`. Finally, it counts occurrences of a substring and checks if the string starts or ends with specific values.

### operators.py
This Python code snippet illustrates the use of assignment operators, basic arithmetic operations, membership testing, and functions for calculating the area of various geometric shapes. It begins by demonstrating assignment operators such as `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `//=`, `%=`, and `**=` through examples that manipulate the variable `x`. The code then performs basic arithmetic operations between two variables, `x` and `y`, calculating addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, and floor division, with results printed for each operation. 

Next, it checks the membership of elements in a list named `names` using `in` and `not in` operators. The code includes functions to calculate the area of a circle, triangle, and rectangle, utilizing user input for dimensions. Each area function uses a mathematical formula and returns the calculated area, which is then printed to the console. Overall, this snippet effectively demonstrates foundational programming concepts in Python.
